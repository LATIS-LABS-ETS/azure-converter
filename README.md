# azure-converter

A small c++ based library to extract and align RGBD images captured using Kinect Azure. 

# Setup Instructions
This library is based on building your own docker image to use the kinect sdk which works only with Ubuntu 18.04. However, the default Ubuntu 18.04 image does not work due to unavailability of opengl capabilities. Hence, we need to build the docker image with the image provided by nvidia. 

Even after building the image there are certain steps necessary to ensure succesful running of this azure-converter application.
